BLURB

    Turns your Chromebook Power-LED into an dual LED for indication of
    HDD activity.

DESCRIPTION

    Although Chromebooks are beautiful devices to use as Linux notebook,
    they are lacking some features you normally found on a PC, like e.g.
    HDD-LED, which comes quite handy to notice abnormal system behavior.

    So this tool will simply turn your blue power LED into and combined
    dual color HDD-/POWER-LED. On HDD activity it turn to orange other-
    wise it stays blue, like original. Its intended to run in background
    as daemon. There are severals command line options, have a look at
    "cb_hddled -h" for help.

    Technically it works by polling the /proc/diskstats to track disk
    activity. On activity it talks to embedded controller (EC) and sends
    LED change color commands. As option (-g) the program can use GPIO
    commands to toggle the LEDs. This might be faster, but for this the
    write protection screw has to be removed, so this is not recommended.

    Its tested only on Intel Hashwell based Chromebooks with TI-LM4 EC
    controller. As ist uses standards commands for EC communication this
    should works with other types of Chromebooks also.

REQUIREMENTS

    Please not the following instructions are tested on Ubuntu 14.04. If
    you are using a different distribution than Ubuntu/Debian you might
    need small adjustments depending on your distribution.

    There are no special dependencies, a minimal build system should
    be enough.
        $ sudo apt-get install build-essential

    As it uses direct hardware access the program has to be run as root.
    If you specify the -g option for GPIO access to LED the system has
    to be unlock, means the write protection screw has to be removed.

INSTALLATION

    Extract archive to working folder
        $ tar -xzvf cb_hddled.tar.gz
        $ cd cb_hddled

    Build it
        $ cd src/
        $ make

    Test it by running as console program.
        $ sudo ./cb-hddledd -c

    If it works as expected you can install it as daemon to start at
    system startup. The daemon understands some parameters, look at
    'cb-hddledd -h' for more info.
        $ sudo cp cb-hddledd /usr/sbin/
        $ cd ../scripts/
        $ sudo cp cb-hddledd /etc/init.d
        $ sudo update-rc.d cb-hddledd defaults

    For correct indication of suspend state its important to shutdown
    the daemon on entering system suspend mode.
        $ sudo cp 05_hddled_suspend /etc/pm/sleep.d
